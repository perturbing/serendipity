# Serendipity
This project presents an innovative Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol developed on the Cardano blockchain. The objective is to demonstrate a robust stochastic selection process for determining the next eligible participant to perform an action on some state. This process exemplifies a unique blend of randomness and decentralization, offering an exciting peek into the future potential of more decentralized protocol designs built on Cardano.

To illustrate this, this project presents a proof of concept protocol that uses the above PoS method to establish a 'randomness oracle network'. With this application, users can achieve onchain trustworthy randomness with high security and quality. All this while maintaining the deterministic nature of Cardano's extended unspent transaction output (e-UTxO) model.

# Build
Enter a development shell via
```bash
nix develop github:input-output-hk/devX/e0037345b5874979cb6a304915714348febdae65#ghc8107-iog
```
or if do a `direnv allow`.
