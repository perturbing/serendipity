# Serendipity
This project presents an innovative Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol developed on the Cardano blockchain. Our objective is to demonstrate a robust stochastic selection process for determining the next eligible participant to perform an action on a global state. This process exemplifies a unique blend of randomness and decentralization, offering an exciting peek into the future potential of blockchain technology.
